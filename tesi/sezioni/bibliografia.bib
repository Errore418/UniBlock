abstract = {This paper explores the barriers and drivers of diffusion associated with permissionless and permissioned blockchains, seeking to establish whether they are the same or different and whether barriers and drivers change over time. The study was undertaken in two stages: (i) interviews in 2016 that examine the barriers and drivers of diffusion; followed by (ii) a case study in 2019 of the Italian wine industryâ€™s permissioned blockchain. The results show that diffusion is reaching a final stage for permissionless blockchains but is lagging behind for permissioned blockchains due to the different barriers and drivers of diffusion. The implications from this study are that: (i) drivers and barriers for different types of technological innovation may be different and change over time; (ii) initial barriers may be surmounted and become features of the underlying technology; (iii) barriers may become drivers of a technology; (iv) drivers of one type of technology may spill-over to become drivers for another type; (v) diffusion may be measured by both the number of adoptions and the number of participants in that technology; (vi) off-chain processes may become a major barrier for permissioned blockchains; and finally (vii) self-interest may be the key driver of technological innovation.}

  abstract={Blockchain is a distributed ledger that gained a prevalent attention in many areas. Many industries have started to implement blockchain solutions for their application and services. It is important to know the key components, functional characteristics, and architecture of blockchain to understand its impact and applicability to various applications. The most well-known use case of blockchain is bitcoin: a cryptocurrency. Being a distributed ledger, consensus mechanism is needed among peer nodes of a blockchain network to ensure its proper working. Many consensus algorithms have been proposed in literature each having its own performance and security characteristics. One consensus algorithm cannot serve the requirements of every application. It is vital to technically compare the available consensus algorithms to highlight their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases. We have identified and discussed parameters related to performance and security of consensus in blockchain. The consensus algorithms are analyzed and compared with respect to these parameters. Research gap regarding designing an efficient consensus algorithm and evaluating existing algorithms is presented. This paper will act as a guide for developers and researchers to evaluate and design a consensus algorithm.},
